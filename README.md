# n8n-discord-bot

how to start

first u need to know that this pogram can't be run on an localhost because an google api can't connect with it
i have used the n8n website to run my program but u can also setup your own server

before u can run this program u will need to enter a few credentials

one. connect to google, this is done by:
opening the google calender wiget,
selecting Credential to connect with
and then pressing an already existing account of pressing create new Credential

two. u will need to connect an webhook from discord, this is done by:
going to your discord server
pressing the settings weel of the chanel u want the bot in
going to intergrations
press create webhook
press on the just created bot
press copy webhook url, also you can use this menu to rename your bot
finaly u need to go to the discord widgets and copying in the url in the section Webhook URL
your link will need to look like this "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1169217433152782368/yJGqhusTSLh1XFbcYnFwznZUMWkGyyfYY_KLi9Q1xqvgOBSq7li2Wi8dCl70nyy8lEO5"



if al of the above is done u just need to press execute and then u sould a message that look likt this:
date today these activity's are planned on the callender
no activity's planned for today

or like:
date today these activity's are planned on the callender
goole calender link
"calelander plan name " at time of plan
